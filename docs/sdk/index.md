# Examples

<info-box>
	Use the **navigation tree on the left** to navigate through CKEditor 4 examples.
</info-box>

All editor features were divided into two main categories, available in the sidebar on the left:

 * **End-user Features** – functionality that your users will see and use.
 * **Integration Features** – more advanced stuff that a CKEditor 4 integrator might need.

The samples are complemented with {@link guide/dev/features/README relevant documentation articles} which explain the features even more broadly — these are always available in the **Documentation** link next to the sample header. You can also find additional reading in the **Related Features** section down below the sample.

Most importantly, though, you can view and copy the exact source code of each editor demo in the **Get Sample Source Code** section at the bottom of the sample pages. This code uses the [CKEditor CDN](https://cdn.ckeditor.com/), so you can save it and run locally without the need to download CKEditor 4 itself!
